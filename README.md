# 👋 Hi, I’m Lê Trần Nhật Nam
**Frontend Developer | DevOps Enthusiast**

🎓 I’m a final-year student majoring in **Software Engineering**, passionate about building scalable web systems and automating deployment pipelines.  
💼 I recently completed a **6-month internship at Intel**, where I worked on the **VisionGuard AI defect detection system**, focusing on edge AI deployment, synthetic dataset generation, and system modularization.  
🚀 I’m now looking for an opportunity to apply my **Frontend** and **DevOps** skills in a professional environment.
